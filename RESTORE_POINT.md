# Restore Point

This file marks a restore point created on May 6, 2025 before modifying the logging configuration.

The following systems are working correctly:
- MT5 EA signal reception
- Trade execution for some signals
- Chart generation and analysis
- Signal generation

Issues noted:
- Excessive logging causing possible performance impact
- Some BUY_NOW and SELL_NOW signals not being executed by MT5 EA despite AutoTrade=true
- Inconsistent trade execution

This restore point is created before implementing option 2 logging configuration (keeping important INFO logs while filtering out the excessive ones).
